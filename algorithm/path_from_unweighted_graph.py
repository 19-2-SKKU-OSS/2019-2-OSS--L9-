Given an unweighted directional graph G, write a program to find out whether there is a path from i to j for all vertices (i, j).

The first line gives the number of vertices N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Lines 2 through N give the adjacency matrix of the graph. 
If the j number of the i line is 1, it means that there is an edge from i to j. The i number in line i is always zero.

Print the correct answer in question in adjacency matrix form over a total of N lines. 
If there is a path from vertex i to j, the jth number on line i should be printed as 1, otherwise 0.
